I've only had it for about 6 weeks.\n\nProduct: AirFlow Pro\nSerial Number: HD-002-583921\nPurchase Date: December 18, 2025\nPurchased from: Amazon\n\nI have the receipt and can provide it if needed. This is clearly a defect as I've\ntaken good care of it and only use it normally.\n\nMy address for shipping:\nJohn Smith\n123 Main Street\nBoston, MA 02101\n\nPlease let me know how to proceed with the warranty claim.\n\nThank you,\nJohn Smith\njohn.smith@gmail.com"
