    "body": "Hello,\n\nI own a small salon and purchased the SalonMaster 3000 for professional use about\n4 months ago. The motor has started making a grinding noise and sometimes cuts out.\n\nI know this is a professional-grade dryer approved for salon use, and I believe\nit should still be under the 180-day warranty.\n\nProduct: SalonMaster 3000\nSerial: HD-005-192847\nPurchase Date: 2025-10-04\nOrder #: AMZ-9876543\n\nPlease process this warranty claim. I rely on this dryer for my business.\n\nLisa Chen\nBeauty First Salon\n100 Commerce St\nSan Francisco, CA 94102\nlisa.stylist@salonbeauty.com"
