I'm torn between the SalonMaster 3000 and the SalonMaster Elite.\n\nCan you explain:\n- What are the main differences between these two models?\n- Which one has a longer warranty?\n- Is the Elite worth the extra cost for salon use?\n- Do both support continuous professional use?\n\nThanks for your time!\nLisa"
